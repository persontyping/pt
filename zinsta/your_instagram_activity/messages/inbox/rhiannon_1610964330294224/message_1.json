So fucked up that Aboriginal people had to have a special pass to be able to be in certain areas and out at certain times. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come so far, but the amount of racists this country still has is shit. I felt so sad when the referendum was voted no. \n\nHope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling better now dude! \n\nThank you so much \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f. I am allowed to tell people about it as Ryf is open about this stuff, Esp if it raises awareness. But it was all types of dv and coercive control. Physical, mental, sexual, financial abuse. Thankfully we have a good relationship and I learnt about it. She cut off all ties when she was pregnant so they know nothing about the baby. But then there were some incidents after he was born that made Ryf feel even more unsafe. Will fill you in when I do see you. But basically he ex is a bad person. Which is why we have kept it a secret about us moving away.",
